      "JDK: The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development kit that provides a set of tools and libraries for developing Java applications. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is necessary for running Java programs, as well as development tools such as compilers and debuggers. The JDK is essential for developers who want to write, compile, and run Java code.",
      "JRE:The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a package that provides the libraries and JVM required to run Java applications. It does not include development tools, making it suitable for users who only need to run Java programs without developing them. The JRE is a subset of the JDK and is included in the JDK installation.",
      "JVM: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a crucial component of the JRE that provides the runtime environment for Java programs. It is responsible for executing Java bytecode on any platform that supports JVM, making Java a “write once, run anywhere” language. The JVM is included in the JRE and is not installed separately.",

      "Robust : Strong memory management, exception handling,and type checking",
      "Multithreaded : Supports multiple programming",
      "Architectural Neural : No dependency on processor architecture",
      "Portable : Java bytecode can be transferred and run on any platform",
      "High Performance : Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler improves performance.",
      "Secure : Provides a secure environment with features like bytecode verification",
      "sandboxing : Sandboxing is a security mechanism in Java that restricts the execution of untrusted code in a controlled environment",
